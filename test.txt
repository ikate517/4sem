First, I’d like to tell you about Timber Cutters. Timber cutter or a logger may seem like a simple job to do. Go to the forest in the morning with a sharp ax and try to chop off the trees. It is only then you will realise the level of strength and endurance these people need to exhibit. A timber cutter has to face the deadliest and the sharpest saws available. One wrong move and instead of lumber it's a limb that's cut. Also the risk of death from falling trees is certainly high. 
	Let’s turn now to Miners. No matter how precious is the stuff you are mining deep within the earth's belly, it is not more precious than your life and limb. Mine workers are always at a risk of getting trapped underground, running out of oxygen, inhaling toxic gases, humid and unsafe working conditions, etc, which makes mining an extremely dangerous job. Miners truly get down and dirty only for our cars to run on gas and that beautiful diamond on the maiden's finger.
	My next point is Roofers. One false move and roofers can plunge several feet down to their death. Also, other dangers like high winds, getting picked by a panicky crow or maybe the roof crashing down are a part and parcel of their job! That's one heck of a smashing and dangerous job. 
	Next we come to Truck Divers. Driving may seem like a pleasure while you are in your Ferrari, or it may be a fight to reach your destination on time during peak traffic hour. But for these long distance truck drivers it's a matter of life and death. Irregular working hours, poor lighting, fatigue, bad roads (some countries still have potholes in place of roads), poor visibility, harsh weather, add to the risk of driving a heavy vehicle. These drivers spend hours on the road and are always at a risk of getting into an accident. They also have to face vehicle problems like flat tires, engine repair and many other work-related hazards.
